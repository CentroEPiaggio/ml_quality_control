## A deep learning-based quality control loop of the extrusion-based bioprinting process

Code to train and test the models explained in the paper for reproducibility purposes. Two main files should be run:

1. **train_cross_val.py**, script to perform the depth and model_conf selection using cross-validation
2. **retrain.py**, script to train the final model and evaluate it on the test dataset

Dependecies to run the scripts: pandas, tensorflow, keras, sklearn
